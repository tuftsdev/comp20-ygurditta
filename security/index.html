	<p>As a security consultant, I've been hired to detect and resolve security issues that exist in the application.
	The application is a modification of the popular game, 2048. Upon completion, the application allows a user to input
	their username. The username is then stored with the user's other game details such as their final score and board
	placement at time of game end. The application then also allows these usernames and scores can then later be retrieved
	in JSON or an HTML scoreboard.</p>
	<p>In order to identify concerns with security in this application, I heavily utilized cURL. With the use of curl, I was
	able to make an HTTP POST request to the web server. This just means that I was able to send data over to the web server.
	From there the web server decides what to do with the data sent by me - in this case, the server inputs the data into a database.
	That same data is then extracted from the database and displayed on a webpage when a user navigates to a specific URL. Other
	than cURL, I used a plugin called Tamper Data to intercept and manipulate the data being submitted to the server (and database) after the
	data had already been submitted from the webpage. This allowed me to manually change certain data that I am not able to do from the front
	end.</p>
	<p>There were several issues found with the application in its current state. The biggest issue involved the lacking limitations to what 
	information could be submitted in the username box. This leaves the application prone to attacks on the main page with very minimal
	modifications using outside tools. Using tools to further manipulate the application has led to the discovery of other vulnerabilities.
	This includes the ability to inject a script into the database. Once the data from the database is attempted to be displayed on a webpage,
	the script is run. In the case I tested, I inserted code to automatically redirect to another page. Using the same vulnerability, I was able
	to create an alert pop up box that says the page has been hacked. Other than that, I was able to enter only partial data into the database as
	well as more than three pairs of data. This opens up the database to improper data sources and types.
	For example, I was able to enter letters in a data key for storing numbers.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Issue #1 Found: Bad Coding Practices - allowing incorrect quantity and types of data</th>
			<li>Location: URL is https://stormy-reef-94850.herokuapp.com/</li>
			<li>Severity: Medium - Is not directly harmful but can create privacy breaches to the database</li>
			<li>I made a POST request with fewer data values than I should have been able to. The data I submitted was inserted as is,
			without checking for the data quantity and types. View missing grid details below.</li>

			<img src="pics/score_board.png" /><br>
			<li>Recommendation: Add an if statement in the POST method of the index.js file such that it checks that all data types exists and
			are not null. Also ensure that no other key value pairs are being entered into the database that are not expected.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Issue #2 Found: Database Injection - Redirecting Webpage</th>
			<li>Location: URL is https://stormy-reef-94850.herokuapp.com/</li>
			<li>Severity: High - can be used for malicious attacks such as taking user data. Imagine a hacker creating the same page but redirecting
			users to their version and then collecting user info to their own databse.</li>
			<li>I injected a line of code into the database through curl to make it go to another webpage.</li>
			<img src="pics/terminal_redirect.png" /><br>
			<li>Difficult to show this actually occuring in a screenshot or photo. If https://stormy-reef-94850.herokuapp.com/ is typed in browser, 
			the page will redirect.</li>
			<li>Recommendation: Add a line of code that sanitizes and input data. In the index.js file under the POST method where the request string 
			is taken in, it should be sanitized prior to being entered into the database. Sample code shown at bottom of report.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Issue #3 Found: Database Injection - Alert Pop Up Box</th>
			<li>Location: URL is https://stormy-reef-94850.herokuapp.com/</li>
			<li>Severity: Medium - can be used to make site look unprofessional</li>
			<li>I injected a line of code into the database through curl to make some text pop up in an alert box</li>

			<li>Recommendation: Add a line of code that sanitizes and input data. In the index.js file under the POST method where the request string 
			is taken in, it should be sanitized prior to being entered into the database. Sample code shown at bottom of report.</li>
