### Movie Annotation Lab

I have implemented a css file to add design to the index.html file
I've completed all javascript in the script tag in the index to properly
quote the movie.

I asked Doug for some help with a bug that Ming was eventually able to 
help me solve. I had declared the time variable outside the function and
did not update the variable within it, preventing it from being updated
with the actual current time of the video - it was stuck at zero.

I spent about 2.5 hours on this lab - a lot of was spent on trying to debug
and doing research about how the addEventLister() function works.
