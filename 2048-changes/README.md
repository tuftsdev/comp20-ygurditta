## 2048 Game Center - Score Keeper

- I'm pretty sure that I have implemented everything in this lab correctly.
I learned a lot more about using Node.js and Express to create a Web Server.
I also learned a lot more about Mongo DB and how to implement it with Heroku.

- I received a lot of help on this project but all the help I received really 
helped me build a strong foundation. The TA's were extremely helpful in getting
me to understand every component of this project - especially Elif, John, Marcus,
Vincent, and David. 

- The assignment in total took me about 7-8 hours to complete.
