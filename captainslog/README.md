## Lab 6: Captain's Log

I have implemented some jQuery aspects such as prepend and $ selectors
I have also utilized local storage to display strings that had previously been entered.

The assignment took about 1.5 hours to complete because I had to do a bit of research
and play around with my code so everything occured in the correct order.
