COMP 20 Lab 4
Responsive Design - Homer

It took me some time but I think I learned how to properly implement the @media rules.
I had no idea why the screen was blanking when the screen was between 400px and 800px but realized
that I had a type .homer as .hover and it was not reasing the @media rule. 

I spent about 1 hour on this lab. This included the time to create the new repo on my machine.
