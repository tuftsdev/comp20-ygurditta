## Assignment 2: MBTA

I have correctly implement the request for the MBTA JSON file that was then parsed correctly.
I was able to create polylines and insert markers with custom icons on the map using Google Maps API.
I had a difficult time with the markers' infowindows.

I received help on this project from two TA's who helped me out a lot: Vincent and Elif 
I also received some help with the JSON components from Doug since I missed that lecture. 

I spent about 12 hours on this assignment. In this time, I learned how to deal with asyncronous function
and became much more familiar dealing with JS objects and the Google Maps API.
