This repository contains most of the assignments I worked on during my fall semester of my Sophomore year in my COMP20 class.
I think my favorite assignment of the ones in this repo was the MBTA one. It was very challenging but extremely rewarding to complete. 
I can also see real world applications of it which makes it all the more interesting of an assignment. 
Since day one of this course, I've grown a lot. I came in with some experience in HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Although I had front end skills
coming in, I've greatly improved on them and also learned so much about back end using Node.js and Heroku.
One of the most important lessons I learned in this course was the ability to use my resources. This means everyone from my classmates,
TA's, and users of online communities such as Stack Overflow. This skill was improved the most during the group semester project. 
As a COMP11 student, I was felt the need to get every program functioning without the help of a TA. This semester I learned that doing
that was a mistake. Although I learned a lot independently, I completely missed out on learning from the perspective of someone
who was in my shoes not too long before. 
In the future, I plan to continue strengthening my skills in back end technologies. I think although somewhat difficult, using Node.js was 
awesome and want to learn more about similar technologies and how to implement them with databases such as MongoDB.
